how to play 
use up key or space key 

my inspirstion for this game was when I in high school this was my favorite game to play on my phone, then it was taken off the app store so I wasnt able to play the game. After I upgraded my phone I couldn't play the game anymore. for this reason decided to recreate flappy bird to give me some nostalgia back. My biggest challenge for this project was to get the pipes to load on the background and get the to fit with my dimensions
